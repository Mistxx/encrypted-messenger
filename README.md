This is a self-hosted, Python-based messaging application that prioritizes security and privacy. The software features a Discord-like interface with direct messaging and group chat functionality, built using PyQt6 for a smooth and modern user experience.

🔒 Security & Encryption
128-bit Encryption: All messages are encrypted using a 128-bit encryption key, ensuring data confidentiality during transmission.
Server-Side Storage: User information and message history are securely stored on the server, minimizing the risk of data leaks on the client side.
Cloud Key Storage (Planned): While the current implementation uses a hardcoded key, future updates will integrate cloud-based key management for enhanced security.

🚀 Features
Direct Messaging & Group Chats: Connect with friends and create group conversations seamlessly.
Modern UI: Inspired by Discord, the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
Cross-Platform Support: The application can run on any system with Python and PyQt6 installed.
